Develop a configurable application which can be used to mock different web services. The application must accept an HTTP request
and return a configurable response.

The solution must be implemented in Java. Please do not use any third-party libraries for web-services; rely only
on javax.servlet.* for creating an HTTP listener.

Include sample configuration for two services:

- Weather service: returns weather information by city code passed as a parameter in the query string

- Geo-location service: returns time zone by ZIP code given in the POST
